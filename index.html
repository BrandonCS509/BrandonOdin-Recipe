<h1> Brandons Classic Mediterranean Recipes </h1>

<p> The Mediterranean diet places an emphasis on fresh, colorful eating and shuns heavily processed ingredients.<br> Trust me, your plate will never be boring. Even better news: though "diet" is in the name, this plan is more of<br> a holistic approach to eating that relies on real foods. You won't be counting calories or macronutrients like you<br> would with a typical "diet."

Here are three awesome recipes to make space on your plate for!</p>
