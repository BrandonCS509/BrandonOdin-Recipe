<h2> Recipe </h2>
<ol>

<li><h3>STEP 1</h3>
Mix the oil and garlic together, then rub half over the lamb chops. Season well, then set aside to marinate. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.

<li><h3>STEP 2</h3>
Put the tomatoes on a baking tray, then drizzle over the remaining oil mixture and season. Cook for 8-10 mins until soft, adding the pine nuts for the final 2-3 mins to toast.

<li><h3>STEP 3</h3>
Make the hummus by blitzing all the ingredients together with 2-3 tbsp water until smooth.

<li><h3>STEP 4</h3>
Heat a griddle pan over a medium-high heat and cook the lamb for 4-5 mins on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Hold the fatty side of the meat against the pan for 2-3 mins until crisp. Cover and set aside to rest for 5 mins.

<li><h3>STEP 5</h3>
Spread the hummus over a platter or four plates and top with the tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil, the lamb and watercress. Scatter over the olives, pine nuts, feta and mint, and serve with the flatbreads.
